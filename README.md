##  Achal Kumar Singh
##   QA Engineer

Hello! I'm a passionate Quality Assurance Engineer, dedicated to making software reliable and high-quality. To me, technology isn't just a job; it's a way of life where I enjoy learning and finding joy in what I do, everywhere I go. Currently, I'm focused on creating automated tests using Python and exploring various aspects of testing.

My specialties include automating tests, manual testing, and using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Selenium, and Python. Previously, I worked in the government health sector (NRHM), but I decided to modernize and switch fields. I'm also keenly interested in information security and penetration testing. Let me share more about my skills and experience with you.

## Skills

- **Test Automation:** I have extensive experience in automating test cases using Selenium with Python. I've created robust and maintainable test suites for web applications, improving testing efficiency and coverage.

- **Manual Testing:** I am proficient in manual testing techniques and have a keen eye for detail. I've conducted thorough manual testing to identify and report issues, ensuring the overall quality of software products.

- **Continuous Integration:** I have a strong background in setting up and configuring CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins. This includes automated testing, deployment, and monitoring, enabling rapid and reliable software delivery.

- **Containerization:** I am well-versed in containerization technologies like Docker, which allows me to create isolated and reproducible testing environments, making it easier to manage dependencies and streamline testing.

- **Orchestration:** I have experience with Kubernetes, which I use to manage containerized applications at scale. This knowledge is crucial for ensuring the reliability and scalability of modern applications.

## Projects

- **E-commerce Website Automation:** I developed an end-to-end test suite for a popular e-commerce website using Selenium and Python. This suite automated critical user workflows, reducing testing time and increasing accuracy.

- **CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application:** I implemented a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline for a web application, incorporating automated testing and deployment. This resulted in faster delivery of features and reduced manual intervention.

- **Dockerized Testing Environments:** I created Docker containers for various testing environments, enabling consistent and reproducible testing across different platforms and configurations.

Let's work together to ensure the quality and reliability of software applications! 🚀
